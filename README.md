# DSA-Problems-Java-January-2025

Welcome to my Java DSA Journey repository! This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions in Java, sourced from competitive programming platforms.

## About

Starting January 2025, I have decided to solve and document one DSA question daily. This initiative helps me stay consistent and improve my problem-solving skills while keeping a record of my progress. Each question is tackled in Java, and the solutions are neatly organized for easy reference.

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in DSA concepts.
- Maintain consistency by solving problems daily.
- Share my learning journey to help others in the community.

## Platforms

The questions are sourced from popular competitive programming and learning platforms, including but not limited to:

- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- Codeforces
- GeeksforGeeks
